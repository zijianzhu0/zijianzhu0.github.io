Shuttle Display is a project for my Enterise course at Michigan Tech, where students identify a problem and find their way to solve the problem with the resources provided by the university.

In this project, I identified a problem where people constantly find themselves waiting for the campus shuttle, without knowing the shuttle has left a few minutes early.

By bringing out this project, I hope to provide the shuttle users the last departure time, so they won't be waiting for a shuttle that has already left.

Below are some pictures and a video of this project.
